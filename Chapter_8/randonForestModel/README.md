# Query Optimization


## Prerequisites


1. **Containerization Software:**
   Installation of containerization software is required, such as Docker or Rancher, to manage and run containerized applications.
   - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/)

## Files

- `Dockerfile`: Sets up the PostgreSQL environment.
- `init.sql`: Initialization script to create the `sales` table and insert sample data.
- `run_query.sh`: Bash script to run the queries and compare performance.


## Usage

This example demonstrates how to compare the performance of a PostgreSQL query with and without an index, and with additional memory settings. We will use Docker to set up the PostgreSQL environment and run the necessary SQL commands.

   ```bash
   docker build -t postgres-sales .
   chmod +x run_query.sh
   ./run_query.sh
